###Homework submission process
For a detailed description of how we set up our remotes and submit work, go [here](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_NYC_Apr14_Proto/tree/master/w01/homework_submission).

At the end of the day, you should have a folder structure that looks something like this 

```bash

	-code
      -wdi
        - projects
        - misc
        - WDI_NYC_Apr14_Proto
```
